# Flower-Recognition-using-CoreML

People have sought ways to cultivate, buy, wear or otherwise be around flowers and blooming plants, partly due to their pleasant appearance and smell. Although flower species abound in most environments co-inhibited by humans, most species are still unknown to them. 
Recognition technology is necessary task to achieve, such that it provides humans with the knowledge of flowers they encounter. 
This app aims to propose a system with Machine Learning to detect a particular flower from a photograph and give a brief information about it from Wikipedia.

**Features:
•	Capturing Flower Image.
•	Using ML to identify category of flower.
•	Displaying brief information of that flower along with the image.
•	Timeline for unknown flower images that can be further used for scientific research.
•	Providing offline information about flowers, categorised based on region.**
